    Here are some reviews from my tour of Seattle coffee shops, written with scientific precision. The results have a
    sample size of 1, and I am a highly untrained sommelier. The main reason for my circuit was to expand my tea hobby
    into a general hot drinks interest. It combined with my bouldering excursions to round out the stereotypical
    Software Engineer experience.

    I've opted not to include prices. Given I won't be keeping the prices up-to-date, recording how much I paid would
    only set up visitors for sticker shock, or perhaps spawn wistful "back in my day"'s. Wasn't that a believable
    explanation? That ascribes more foresight to past me than is fair; I only decided to release these as
    reviews for the web-dev practice. Any inspiration one might gain from this caffeinated navel-gazing is a happy
    side effect!

    When I visited Seattle in 2023 the average espresso would set you back $4. If I had to speculate, the present price
    of espresso is much higher per liter than gas. Tastier, too.

    Enough rambling! If you've made it this far, click the reviews link to see my (in)complete list of (mostly) Seattle
    espresso reviews.
